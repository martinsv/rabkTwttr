rabkTwttr
=========

A Twitter API library in PHP


Setup
=========

To get started, you'll need to register your application with Twitter. As of June 11, 2013, Twitter API v1.0 was deprecated and developers are now asked to migrate to v1.1. The new version requires authentication for all queries (even searching for tweets), presumably to clamp down on requests that burden Twitter servers.


Sample - Search for tweets
=========

```php
<?php

include "rabkTwttr.php";


?>
```
